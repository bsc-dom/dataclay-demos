# dataClay demos

Welcome! Here you will find several demos that use dataClay. You can use it to familiarize with it and see how it works. 

Remember that demos are intended to give a demonstration of typical dataClay applications and architectures: to show how dataClay works, is prepared, or is done while examples are used to learn how to use dataClay, to make something similar to the demos and match your requirements. You can find dataClay examples at https://github.com/bsc-dom/dataclay-examples

To read the usage manual, go to https://www.bsc.es/dataclay 

Per each demo available you have a subfolder with its own structure and documentation.
